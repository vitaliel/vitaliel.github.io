I like Elixir a lot and I did some small projects for myself:

Few API calls for Assembla.com

Command line tool escript that create Merge Requests at Assembla
https://github.com/assembla/ex_assembla_cli

Go port for Elixir to catch STDOUT and STDERR separately.
https://github.com/vitaliel/erl_exec

Prototype for custom SSHD daemon with public key auth from external source.
